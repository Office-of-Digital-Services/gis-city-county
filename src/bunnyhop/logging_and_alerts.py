    Let's set up some kind of logging and alerting here.
    We'll want to print to the console, but probably also keep some kind of log that we email at the end, *or*
    if we encounter some kind of fatal error.

    GitHub could be a great spot to post the log. On success, we create an issue there, then close it immediately.
    On failure, we create the issue (with a scary title), then leave it open and assign it to Nick.
